redo data format

current format is:

dropoff/pickups
time down to minute, gps location


want to convert into the format:
time down to hour, gps location of pickups
time down to hour, gps location of dropoffs

[
{
time_id: '5/1/2012 0:',
pickups: [], 
dropoffs: []
}
]

// would be nice to keep this as GPS coordinates (in JS we can transform and aggregate)

is this reasonable or is more aggregation needed?
5 months of data
5 * 30 * 24

unclear how long pickups / dropoffs is -- probably want aggregation

---

so the current code is doing this on change:

var iter = x_hover_to_iter(currentMousePos.x);
show_data_for(iter % (24*4));

	var equation = make_equation(seq[iter]);

var seq = data_5_1;
var data_5_1 = [[[-1.09,3.57,0.3],[-4.9,4.76,0.3],[3.83,6.14,0.3],...

should probably use the existing latlng -> xfrac, yfrac code in produce_data.py

let's delete stuff and refactor the file first

see if we can get the mesh's showing up

pretty cool but hurts your eyes

stopped here: get wireframe into existing code

first, reading some threejs tutorials
https://www.august.com.au/blog/animating-scenes-with-webgl-three-js/

renderer
scene
camera

// mesh: geometry + material
var plane = new THREE.Mesh(
	new THREE.PlaneGeometry( 5, 5, 5, 5 ),
	new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { color: 0x222222, wireframe: true } )
);
plane.rotateX(Math.PI/2);
scene.add( plane );


we can get rid of the render loop!!
